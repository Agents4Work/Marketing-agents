	•	How these AI agents work together, just like a real marketing team.
	•	How they communicate, strategize, and optimize marketing tasks without human intervention.

✅ Technical overview of automation—but keeping it simple and easy to understand for business owners and marketers.
✅ Landing page-ready output with a modern scrolling effect (like in the provided code).

⚠️ Warnings (Guidelines & Constraints)

🚀 Use real job role comparisons—explain that this AI replaces positions like:
	•	Marketing Manager
	•	SEO Specialist
	•	Ad Strategist
	•	Copywriter
	•	Data Analyst
🚀 Use analogies & examples—to make it easy to visualize how AI takes action.
🚀 Scrolling effect for UI/UX engagement—the explanation should be designed for modern scrolling storytelling on a landing page.
