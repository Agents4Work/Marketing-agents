Alright, let’s structure the prompts for the Personal & Settings section so the AI agent builds it correctly.

⸻

🎯 Goal (Objective)

We are creating a Personal & Settings dashboard where users can manage their profile, app preferences, and subscription plans. The design should be clean, intuitive, and efficient.

📌 Sections to Include:
1️⃣ User Profile → Manage personal information, profile picture, and account security.
2️⃣ App Settings → Customize notifications, AI preferences, and integrations.
3️⃣ Subscription → View plan details, upgrade/downgrade, billing info.

⚡ Core UI/UX Requirements

✅ Navigation should be simple & accessible from the sidebar.
✅ Modern, high-end UI (not overly cluttered).
✅ Clear CTAs (Save Changes, Upgrade Plan, etc.).
✅ Security-first approach for sensitive settings (password updates, billing, etc.).

🚀 Next Steps

💡 Do we need team management settings (if multi-user accounts are supported)?
💡 Should AI auto-suggest the best plan based on usage? (e.g., “You’re exceeding your limits, consider upgrading.”)

Let me know if you want to refine this further before implementation! 🚀🔥
