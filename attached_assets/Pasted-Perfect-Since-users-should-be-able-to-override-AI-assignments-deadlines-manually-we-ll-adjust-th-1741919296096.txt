Perfect! Since users should be able to override AI assignments & deadlines manually, we’ll adjust the prompts to ensure Replit AI builds this flexibility correctly. Here’s the final optimized version:

🔥 Finalized Prompt for Replit AI - AI Task & Content Dashboard

🎯 Goal (Objective)

“We are creating a Unified AI Task & Content Dashboard, combining an AI-powered Task List (To-Do List), AI Calendar, and Auto-Publish & Scheduling. This system allows users to plan content, assign tasks, and schedule publishing efficiently, while ensuring users can manually override AI-generated assignments & deadlines if needed.”

✅ Key Features & Workflow:
1️⃣ Task List (To-Do List)
	•	Users add content-related tasks, and AI assigns the appropriate AI agent team automatically.
	•	Users can manually edit task assignments or deadlines.
	•	AI suggests deadlines, but users can override them at any time.

2️⃣ AI Calendar
	•	Visual dashboard showing all content plans, tasks, and publishing schedules.
	•	Clicking any task or deadline opens details, allowing users to adjust manually.
	•	AI adjusts related deadlines dynamically (e.g., if a blog deadline is moved, its publishing schedule updates).

3️⃣ Auto-Publish & Scheduling
	•	Only final, approved content appears here (NO drafts or incomplete tasks).
	•	AI suggests optimal publishing times, but users can manually reschedule.
	•	Direct integration with publishing platforms (social media, blogs, emails).

🔥 Replit AI - Feature Breakdown & Rules

1️⃣ Task List (To-Do List) - AI Agent Assignment & Overrides

✅ Task List Rules for AI Execution:
	•	AI auto-assigns tasks to the correct AI agent team (e.g., SEO Blog → AI Copywriter + SEO Specialist).
	•	Users can override AI’s team assignment and select different AI agents if needed.
	•	AI suggests a deadline, but users can manually adjust it.
	•	Once a task is added, it appears in the AI Calendar automatically.

2️⃣ AI Calendar - Dynamic Task & Publishing View

🔹 Prompt:
“The AI Calendar is a global planning view where users see all content tasks, deadlines, and publishing schedules. AI dynamically updates deadlines based on dependencies, but users can manually override any scheduled date.”

✅ Calendar Rules for AI Execution:
	•	Clicking on any event/task opens detailed editing options (team, deadlines, progress).
	•	Drag-and-drop functionality allows easy rescheduling.
	•	AI auto-updates dependent tasks if one deadline changes, but users can disable this automation for manual control.
	•	Three color-coded categories:
	•	🔵 Tasks in Progress
	•	🟢 Content Ready
	•	🔴 Overdue Tasks

🚨 Manual Overrides:
	•	Users can manually change any deadline or dependency.
	•	AI provides rescheduling suggestions, but users must approve changes.

3️⃣ Auto-Publish & Scheduling - Finalized Content Queue

🔹 Prompt:
“Auto-Publish & Scheduling is where final, approved content is queued for publishing. AI suggests the best posting time based on engagement trends, but users can manually override the schedule.”

✅ Publishing Rules for AI Execution:
	•	Only final, approved content appears here—NO drafts or incomplete content.
	•	AI suggests optimal publishing times based on engagement trends, but users can reschedule manually.
	•	Direct integrations with WordPress, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
	•	Users must approve the publishing schedule before content goes live.
