🛠️ Improved Prompt: Next-Gen AI Team Builder

🎯 Goal:

Design a human-like, interactive AI team builder where agents feel like real collaborators instead of robotic boxes. Once placed inside the workflow, agents should appear as profile-based entities that users can click to interact with, modify, and assign tasks.

⸻

2️⃣ Core Features

👤 Agent Profiles (Human-Like Representation)

✅ Visual Representation:
	•	Agents should look like real profiles, not abstract shapes.
	•	Use circular avatars or profile cards instead of generic boxes.
	•	Allow custom avatars (upload or auto-generate).
	•	Display name, role, and bio directly on the profile.

✅ Interactive Customization (Click-to-Modify)
	•	Clicking on an agent inside the workflow should open an interactive panel where users can:
	•	Edit details (expertise, personality traits, working style).
	•	Attach reference documents & materials.
	•	Define collaboration rules (e.g., “Always work with Product Marketer”).

⸻

🔗 Smart & Dynamic Connections

✅ Natural, Meaningful Links (No Plain Arrows!)
	•	Agents should connect through smart, interactive relationships:
	•	🔵 Collaboration – Agents work together on the same task.
	•	🟢 Approval Flow – One agent must approve before the next moves forward.
	•	🟠 Feedback Loop – Work is reviewed and sent back if needed.
	•	Clicking a connection allows users to edit rules (dependencies, review process, workflow type).

⸻

📊 Workflow Interaction & Management

✅ Drag & Drop Functionality
	•	Agents can be moved and positioned dynamically.
	•	The layout should automatically adjust for clean & structured workflows.

✅ Status Indicators & Activity Tracking
	•	Each agent and connection should display real-time status:
	•	🟡 Pending – Waiting for action.
	•	🔵 In Progress – Actively working.
	•	✅ Completed – Task finished.

⸻

🚀 Final Execution Goal

Build a modern, intelligent AI workflow builder where agents are human-like, interactive, and dynamically connected—creating a natural, seamless, and engaging experience for users.
