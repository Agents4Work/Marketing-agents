Got it! The AI Task Manager & Planner should function as a smart, AI-powered workflow system that:

1️⃣ To-Do List (Task List) → Users add tasks, and AI assigns the correct AI agent team to handle them.
2️⃣ AI Calendar → Tasks automatically sync to a dynamic calendar with deadlines.
3️⃣ Auto-Publish & Scheduling → Only for scheduling and publishing finalized content.

🚀 Final AI Prompt for Replit AI

🎯 Goal (Objective)
Develop a Smart AI Task Manager & Planner where users can track content tasks, manage deadlines in a calendar, and assign AI-powered teams automatically.

📌 Return Format (Expected Output)
The AI should generate a structured, intuitive dashboard with the following workflow:

🔹 Main Section: AI Task Manager & Planner (Dashboard View)
✅ Task List (To-Do List) – Users create content-related tasks.
	•	AI auto-assigns the right AI team (e.g., Blog team, Social Media team).
	•	Tasks automatically sync to the calendar.
	•	Users can manually adjust AI assignments if needed.

✅ AI Calendar – A dynamic timeline where all content deadlines, AI-generated tasks, and publishing schedules appear.
	•	Clicking a task opens details & action options.
	•	AI suggests deadlines based on urgency & workload.

✅ Auto-Publish & Scheduling – Only for finalized content that is ready to go live.
	•	Users select publishing platforms (Social Media, Email, Website, etc.).
	•	AI suggests best posting times based on engagement trends.

⸻

⚡ Core AI Functionality
	•	Seamless Workflow – A task added in the To-Do List is automatically assigned to an AI Team and added to the AI Calendar.
	•	Task Dependencies – If a task is overdue, the system suggests adjustments.
	•	Smart AI Assignments – AI detects the right team based on the task type.

⸻

⚠️ Warnings & Constraints
	•	Keep UX simple → Users should not feel overwhelmed switching between views.
	•	AI assignments must be logical → The right AI agents must be chosen for each task.
	•	Tasks & Calendar should sync in real-time → No delays in updates.

⸻

💡 Next Steps:
✅ Does this structure feel intuitive?
✅ Should users be able to manually adjust AI team assignments?

🔥 Once confirmed, we move to the UI design prompt to ensure the experience is fluid & high-end! 🚀
