💀 The AI butchered it.

🚨 Major Issues & How to Fix Them

❌ 1. The App Sections Are Not Interactive (No Scroll or Proper Functionality)
	•	The lower section (Featured Categories) was supposed to be scrollable—now it’s static and cluttered.
	•	Each app should be displayed in a structured, dynamic grid layout, NOT just dumped in a list.

❌ 2. The Sidebar Icons Are Too Minimalistic & Hard to Read
	•	The AI made the sidebar icons too abstract and small, making it hard to navigate.
	•	We wanted a premium feel, not a stripped-down minimalist approach.

❌ 3. The App Functionalities Are Not Displayed Properly
	•	Each AI functionality (Content Creation, Workflows, AI Agents, etc.) was supposed to be shown properly with explanations—but now they are just sitting there.
	•	The AI didn’t respect the structured hierarchy we gave it.

❌ 4. The Layout Feels Empty & Lacks Visual Balance
	•	Too much white space where there should be better sectioning & padding.
	•	Lack of shadow effects & hover interactions makes it feel cheap.
	•	No proper contrast or highlight for important elements.

🔥 FIX INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AI

🚀 “The lower section should be a horizontal scrollable area, NOT static. Each app category should be inside a card with clear spacing, hover effects, and a structured hierarchy. Icons in the sidebar should be slightly larger and more readable—do NOT make them ultra-minimal. The layout should feel modern and high-end, with soft shadows, structured spacing, and proper padding.”

✅ Fix the Lower Section (Scrolling Categories)
	•	Featured apps should be scrollable, NOT dumped into a grid.
	•	Each app should have an icon + short description.
	•	Use smooth scrolling animations to create a premium feel.

✅ Fix the Sidebar (Better Icons & Visibility)
	•	Icons should be slightly larger & easier to recognize.
	•	Sidebar text needs slightly better spacing to improve readability.

✅ Fix the Functionality Display
	•	AI functionalities should be properly grouped with clear explanations.
	•	No random feature dumping—everything should be structured properly.

✅ Improve Layout Balance (Padding, Spacing, Shadows)
	•	Better spacing between sections.
	•	Use subtle shadows & hover effects to enhance UI aesthetics.
