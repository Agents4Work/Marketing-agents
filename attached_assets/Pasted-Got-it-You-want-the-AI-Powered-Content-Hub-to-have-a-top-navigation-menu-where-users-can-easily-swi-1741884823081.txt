✅ Fixed at the top of the Content Hub so users can instantly switch between content types.
✅ Tab-style menu with soft-rounded buttons, ensuring a clean, seamless user experience.

📌 AI-Powered Content Generation Process (Ensuring High-Quality Output)

Users don’t just type a vague prompt—instead, AI guides them through a structured process for maximum accuracy.

✅ 1️⃣ Context-Aware AI Input System
	•	Instead of a basic text box, users are prompted with structured questions to ensure high-quality AI outputs.
	•	Example for Ad Copy:
	•	“What product/service is this ad for?”
	•	“What’s the main offer or hook?”
	•	“Which platform will this run on?” (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, TikTok)

✅ 2️⃣ AI Live Preview (Real-Time Suggestions)
	•	As users enter input, AI previews how the final content will look.
	•	If the input is too vague, AI suggests improvements dynamically.
	•	Example:
	•	If the user types “Create an ad for a fitness product”, AI responds:
“Would you like to target beginners, athletes, or weight loss customers?”

✅ 3️⃣ Dynamic AI Adjustments Based on User Preferences
	•	Tone of voice selector (Friendly, Professional, Bold, Witty).
	•	Length settings (Short, Medium, Long).
	•	SEO & Engagement Enhancements (Keyword suggestions for SEO, emotional triggers for ads).

✅ 4️⃣ Generated Content Output (Clean & Editable)
	•	Content loads with smooth animations.
	•	Users can edit, refine, or regenerate specific sections.
	•	AI provides alternative versions to improve variations.
