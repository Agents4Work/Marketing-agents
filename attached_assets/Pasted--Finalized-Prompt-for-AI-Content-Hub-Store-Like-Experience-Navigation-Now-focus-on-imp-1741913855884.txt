🔥 Finalized Prompt for AI Content Hub - Store-Like Experience & Navigation

💡 **“Now, focus on implementing the AI-Powered Content Hub as an interactive store-like experience where users can quickly discover, browse, and access AI-powered content tools. The structure should be intuitive, modern, and resourceful, ensuring seamless navigation.

1️⃣ Top Section: AI-Powered Search Assistant
	•	A smart AI search assistant at the top helps users find exactly what they need instantly.
	•	The assistant should auto-suggest relevant tools based on user input.

2️⃣ Scrolling Featured Section: Top AI Tools
	•	Below the search bar, display a horizontal scrolling section of the most-used or recommended AI tools.
	•	Each tool should have a bold icon, name, and short description with a hover effect.

3️⃣ Three Main Content Sections (Large Headers & Descriptions)
	•	Below the featured section, display the three main structured content categories with large section titles:
	•	Content Types (“What kind of content are you creating?”)
	•	Marketing Functions (“What area of marketing are you focusing on?”)
	•	Funnel Stage (“Where in the customer journey is your audience?”)
	•	Each section should have a short explanatory description to guide users.
	•	Clicking a section smoothly transitions into a new view displaying subcategories.

4️⃣ Inside Each Section: AI-Powered Apps Displayed Like a Store
	•	Once inside a section (e.g., “Content Types”), users see a grid layout of AI-powered content creation apps.
	•	Each app should include:
	•	A clean icon & title
	•	Short description of what it does
	•	Subtle hover effect for interactivity
	•	Clicking an app smoothly transitions into the AI-powered prompting system.

📌 Subcategories Breakdown:
	•	Content Types: Users select what kind of content they need (e.g., Blogs, Emails, Ads, Social Media).
	•	Marketing Functions: Users pick their focus (e.g., Product Marketing, Performance Marketing, PR & Comms).
	•	Funnel Stage: Users refine content based on where their audience is (e.g., Awareness, Conversion, Retention).

5️⃣ Smooth UI/UX & High-End Feel
	•	The entire experience should feel like an interactive app store, NOT just static buttons.
	•	Every selection should have a smooth transition effect instead of an abrupt page reload.
	•	Hovering over sections should provide a subtle glow effect to indicate interactivity.

📌 Final Outcome:
✅ Users instantly understand where to find AI-powered tools based on their marketing goals.
✅ The system feels intuitive, smooth, and high-end, guiding users step by step.
✅ The transition from browsing → selecting an app → AI-powered prompting system is seamless.
