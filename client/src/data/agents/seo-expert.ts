## Critical Issues
* Page speed below threshold on mobile (Current: 62/100, Target: 85+)
* 23 pages with duplicate meta descriptions
* 8 critical 404 errors from external backlinks
* XML sitemap outdated (missing 34 new product pages)

## Recommended Fixes (Prioritized)
1. Implement image optimization to improve page speed:

   * Implement lazy loading for below-fold images
   * Set explicit width/height attributes to prevent layout shifts

2. Implement product schema markup:
